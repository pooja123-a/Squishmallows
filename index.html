  <h1 style="color:indigo; font-size:larger;"><marquee>HELLO, WE'RE THE SQUISHMALLOWS!</marquee></h1>
  <p>Hello, we're the squishmallows.
      Grab a friend, we're takin' it easy,
      So soft, cuddle and squeeze me.
      You can kick it on the couch or toss them like a ball,
      You can pick your favorite one or you can just collect us all.
      Love, play, cuddle, squeeze,
      Hello, we're the squishmallows.
      We've all got a story that'll give you the feels,
      Join the squad, the snuggle is real.
      Every color of the rainbow, every shape and size,
      Come along for adventure, mystery and surprise.
      It's like huggin' a cloud softer than a pillow.
      Hello, we're the squishmallows,
      Hello, we're the squishmallows,
      So soft you really won't believe it,
      Stack em up, you know you wanna squeeze them.
      Hello, we're the squishmallows,
      (Squish it, squish it, squish it, squish it, squish it)
      Piper is a penguin and Fifi's a fox,
      Archie axolotl and Simon the sloth,
      Life is just a beach when you're Cameron the cat,
      And Mila's got a trunk full of healthy snacks.
      Love, play, cuddle, squeeze,
      Hello, we're the squishmallows.
      Dinosaurs or dragons what's your fantasy?
      There's a hamster named Humphrey on the silver screen.
      Francis fights fires, Henry's singing a song,
      With a squad like this, you can't go wrong.
      At work, on the go, with your friends at home,
      Need a lift, or a gift, it's so hard to say no.
      When you're all revved up or you're feelin' mellow,
      You'll be huggin' a cloud softer than a pillow.
      Hello, we're the squishmallows,
      Hello, we're the squishmallows.</p>
